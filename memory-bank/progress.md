## What's Left to Build
- ðŸ”„ Implement more example transforms for common use cases
- ðŸ”„ Test container generation with different data types and sizes
- ðŸ”„ Implement proper authorization checks in the collection alkane
- ðŸ”„ Add more comprehensive tests
- ðŸ”„ Add deployment scripts for automation

## Current Status
The project has been fully implemented with all four main components: collection alkane (orbitals-collection-contract), orbital alkane (orbitals-orbital-contract), container alkane (orbitals-container-generator), and sale alkane (orbitals-sale-contract). We've also created a new orbitals-support crate that provides traits and utilities for implementing orbital alkanes. The basic functionality is working, with a particular focus on the container alkane's efficiency and flexibility. We've reimplemented the container alkane as a TypeScript library that can generate minimal WASM containers directly in the browser.

### Implemented Features
1. **Collection Alkane (orbitals-collection-contract)**
   - Factory functionality to create orbital instances
   - Registry system to track instances
   - Data opcode with transform capabilities
   - Proxy functionality to container alkane
   - API for sale alkane integration
   - Special call function for container initialization
   - Container sequence tracking

2. **Orbital Alkane (orbitals-orbital-contract)**
   - Standard token functionality (name, symbol, total supply)
   - Proxy functionality for Data opcode
   - Sequence number handling
   - Superscript index display in name and symbol
   - Collection name/symbol retrieval
   - Implementation of the Orbital trait

3. **Container Alkane (orbitals-container-generator)**
   - TypeScript library for generating containers
   - WAT template with proper memory layout
   - Browser interface for container generation
   - Node.js example for command-line usage
   - Efficient data embedding mechanism
   - Proper CallResponse serialization
   - wabt.js integration for browser compatibility

4. **Sale Alkane (orbitals-sale-contract)**
   - Payment processing functionality
   - Integration with collection alkane
   - Instance limit enforcement
   - Payment verification
   - Bulk purchasing with change calculation
   - Terms of service for legal protection
   - Proper parameter types (u128 values for AlkaneId components)

5. **Orbitals Support Crate (orbitals-support)**
   - BytesTransform trait for data transformations
   - Orbital trait with default implementations
   - Example implementations for custom transforms
   - Documentation for custom transform implementation

### Implementation Details
- The orbital-collection project follows a factory pattern
- The collection alkane acts as a factory for orbital instances
- Each orbital instance has a unique sequence number (address [2, n])
- The Data opcode proxies back to the collection but applies transforms
- The container alkane is now a TypeScript library that generates minimal WASM containers
- The sale alkane handles payment processing and instance creation
- The orbitals-support crate provides traits and utilities for implementing orbital alkanes

## Known Issues
- Transform logic examples need more real-world implementations
- Authorization checks in the collection alkane are simplified
- Container alkane generation requires the wabt.js library for browser usage
- Integration tests are currently limited
- Deployment process requires manual steps

## Next Milestones
1. **Enhance Transform Logic** - Implement more example transforms for common use cases
2. **Test Container Generation** - Test with different data types and sizes
3. **Improve Security** - Implement proper authorization checks in the collection alkane
4. **Comprehensive Testing** - Add more comprehensive tests
5. **Deployment Automation** - Add scripts for automating the deployment process

## Blockers
- None currently identified
