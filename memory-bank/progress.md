# Project Progress

## Completed

### Core Components
- ✅ Implemented the orbital-macros crate for common macros
- ✅ Implemented the collection alkane for standard collections
- ✅ Implemented the collection-child alkane for child orbitals
- ✅ Implemented the bitcoin-collection alkane for Bitcoin-based collections
- ✅ Implemented the bitcoin-sale alkane for Bitcoin-based sales
- ✅ Implemented the container-generator-ts for generating container WASM files

### Deployment
- ✅ Created deployment script (deploy-orbital-collection.sh)
- ✅ Created BTC payment helper script (btc-payment-helper.js)
- ✅ Documented deployment process in memory-bank/deploymentInstructions.md

### Features
- ✅ Token trait implementation for name and symbol functionality
- ✅ OrbitalCollection trait implementation with authorization checks
- ✅ Bitcoin payment processing in the sale alkane
- ✅ Container WASM generation from images
- ✅ Proxy chain for Data opcode
- ✅ Transform logic based on sequence numbers

## In Progress

### Testing
- 🔄 Integration tests for the full workflow
- 🔄 Unit tests for individual components

### Documentation
- 🔄 API documentation for all components
- 🔄 User guide for the orbital collection system

## To Do

### Optimizations
- ⬜ Optimize container WASM size
- ⬜ Improve transform logic performance
- ⬜ Optimize proxy chain for Data opcode

### Features
- ⬜ Support for multiple payment methods
- ⬜ Advanced transform logic for more complex use cases
- ⬜ UI for interacting with the orbital collection system

## Known Issues

### Deployment
- 🐛 "Insufficient Balance" error when deploying contracts with oyl alkane new-contract
  - Workaround: Ensure both Native SegWit and Taproot addresses are funded and transactions are confirmed

### Bitcoin Sale
- 🐛 Potential issues with Bitcoin payment verification in certain edge cases
  - Need to implement more robust verification logic

### Container Generation
- 🐛 Large images may result in oversized container WASM files
  - Need to implement image optimization before container generation
